Gotta start somewhere
Dear me, 
The weather is a bit chilly today. Go do your aircraft design code! Be productive. Stop getting distracted. Also, that startbucks mocha with 6 mocha pumps tasted incredibly good today for some reasons. The ratio between the coffee and the chocolate was on point. Guess that was probably the only thing that was remarkable today. Yay friday! 
Also, craving for fries and pizza and cocktails and pocky. Some cake would be nice. 
Sincerely, 
Also me
